# musicfactory-live
 Django website
 
 Algorithmic task can be found in: algorithmic-task/intervals.py
 Website is hosted on heroku: https://afternoon-taiga-68989.herokuapp.com/
 
 USAGE:
 - When you select create new track and submit it you will get the json and url that should be connected to the host url for image download
 - On the page where you list the songs from the db you have an option Track start time that calculates and returns length of silence at the beging of the song

INFO
- Unfortunatly for some reason download on the local server works but on the hosted one doesn't
- In the calculate start time method I've enabled POST and GET calls for easier implementation of hyperlink request in html
- Some libraries were installed but not used after some variations of the project
